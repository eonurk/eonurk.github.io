Hey there, I am Onur! I am a PhD candidate in Computational Oncology at Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) advised by [Prof. Erik van den Akker](http://www.molepi.nl/en/people/people_item/t/erik_van_den_akker). 

Previously, I was working at [The Jackson Laboratory](https://www.jax.org) as a Computational Biologist. I was a member of [Ucarlab](https://www.ucarlab.com/). I had my MSc in Computer Science (2020) and BSc in Electrics and Electronics Engineering (2017) departments of Bilkent University.
