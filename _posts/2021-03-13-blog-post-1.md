Wow, never heard this one before, huh? 

I know this is a weird thing to do and my friends will probably read these and make fun of me. That's cool though, because I've decided to blog about my PhD (yeey, not fun). This will help me with two things:

- Keeping my sanity
- Seeing my progress (if I can)

Therefore, I salute you all who wants to see a man go crazy!
